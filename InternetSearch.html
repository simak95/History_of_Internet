    <h1>The Story Of Internet - Internet Search</h1>
</div>
<br>

<div class="col-lg-12">
    <p>The roots of the search engine started at Stanford University with two bored electrical engineering students who
        had the genius idea of indexing data about fantasy basketball over the internet. The basic idea was to create a
        directory to navigate all the collected data. Before search engines browsing the internet meant going from one
        FTP server to another.

    <p>Jerry Yang and David Filo founded Yahoo! in January 1994 and incorporated it on March 2, 1995. Yahoo!’s
        business model relied on advertisements. The company was worried that using advertisement was a risky business
        because users could simply rebel and not use Yahoo at all. Soon after, Yahoo!’s advertising triggered the goal
        rush that until today still matters. With the success of Yahoo! came competition and one of the biggest
        competitors was Excite.</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="Images/yahoo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="1000" height="250">
    </div>
    <p>The battle between Yahoo! And Excite was not different than it is today with Bing and Google. If Yahoo!
        Came out with a product so did Excite and vice versa. For both of these companies the larger the user
        base the more money in advertising they could make. But with the focus on advertising, both Yahoo! And
        Excite as well as the rest of the competition, was falling behind in their search algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the search engine companies were focused on advertising, a newcomer to the game would pose the
        challenge that years later will make almost all the competition disappear. January 1996 Larry Page and
        Sergey Brin started their research on a better search engine. Their core idea was that the internet was
        running a popularity contest with its own content, therefore, the more views a page got the more relevant
        its content was.</p>
    <p>In essence, Google interprets a link in page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B. Google then
        assesses the page’s importance by the votes it receives.</p>
    <p>Page and Brin launched Google in Stanford University’s Network and
        it almost broke the network due to how popular it quickly became. Stanford University then kicked google
        out of its network and Page and Brin started their search for funding. The first person to envision the
        Google project was Vinod Khosla a venture capitalist who at the time had invested in Excite and wanted
        Excite to license the search engine from Page and Brin. Google and Excite had a meeting but the Excite
        executives did not agree to license or buy the Google search engine. In their minds, internet search was
        genetic and the Excite search engine was almost as good. Excite could have bought google back then for
        1 Million dollars and be today’s biggest tech company but they passed on the offer <b class="text-dark">(what a
            mistake!!).</b></p>
    <p>Excite was not the only company that turned down Page and Larry’s
        invention. Pretty much every search engine company did because no one believed that you could make real
        money with search engines alone. They all relied on advertising. However, the Google team did not give up,
        instead, they looked for help from one of their professors; David R. Cheriton. David, who had some money
        from a startup that got bought by CISCO, contacted Andy Bechtolsheim to introduce him to the Google team.
        When the team showed Andy a demo of Google, Andy wrote them a check for 100,000 dollars on the spot
        because Google was the best idea he had ever been presented with. Eventually, Page and Brin met John
        Doerr who is the biggest venture capitalist of Silicon Valley. Doerr was convinced of Google’s revenue
        potential and wrote Page and Brin a check for 12 Million dollars.</p>
    <p>Google did not want to base their business model around advertising. Doing so would have turned google
        into just another search engine. This problem was solved by Bill Gross who realized that when people
        were searching for information their queries told not only their interest but also what the7y we
        interested in buying. This could turn an efficient search engine into a marketing tool. Bill Gross’s
        idea was to monetize the keywords that users enter in the search engine. For instance, BMW would pay a
        fortune to make sure that the word “car” returns its website instead of Mattel’s Hotwheels. Gross’ idea
        turned the internet into a yellow pages book. It was this idea that Google mirror. Google named its product
        Adwords and it was just a copy of Bill Gross Overpage.</p>
