        <p class="container-fluid text-justify"> The 21st century has one of the highest progressions when it comes to 
        technological innovation and growth. Televisions was one of the biggest things to hit the 21st century making 
        platforms such as film, tv series, and commercial. However having all that power TV companies decide what they
        want to air and who they want making it a “clubby system”. That all changed with services like YouTube which is 
        a streaming platform giving people the opportunity to film what they want, who they want, when they want with 
        their traditional slogan “Broadcast yourself”. YouTube a startup company that was bought by Google for $1.6 billion
        dollars during that time it was not much but look where they are now. Because of this sale, big television companies
        feared that YouTube would take over the TV industry, this was the steppingstone where it gave us the user the power 
        to publish our own content without having to go to a corporation to air out material. Another start up that had great 
        success is Digg where it publishes news article that isn’t picked by people in a corporate office on what they decide 
        to publish but lets us the people decide what we want to see. Both Youtube and Digg are believers of this concept called
        “the wisdom of crowds”. Which proves that users love to hear the sound of their own voices and the site of their own images
        on the screen. </p>

            <h2 id="the-need-for-an-indestructible-network" class="text-center text-capitalize">Rise and fall of Napster</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="container-fluid text-justify">However, all these technologies are just branching of the one big platform
            that came out before them, that software was Napster. Napster was a entertainment download platform that established 
            a spearheaded distributed P2P file sharing software that shared music, videos, files and all they had to do is go on
            the computer and download anything they want. While Napster was gaining fame and a large following it left a big question,
            “Is their platform legal?” to which not even lawmakers or even celebrities who Napster used to pirate their songs had no idea
            of this. Being surprised that they spent hours or days making songs just to have people pirate and download their work for free,
            it goes to show that the music industry wasn’t happy with what Napster was doing. Then came the barrage of lawsuits and courts cases 
            for Napster and its user and eventual the company was defeated and had to shut down. Even though it was shut down did it stop pirating?
            Did it slow down sales? Did it save these companies money? the quick answer is NO. Where Napster failed, another company were familiar
            with called Apple a few years later got the idea of creating iTunes, where users can download music for a $1 a piece but with strict 
            copyright laws that big corporations were happy they were put in place.  </p>
