        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">A new type of evolution is coming and that kind of innovation which is known as ecommerce and some of the early adopters are now a giant ecommerce powerhouse, for example is companies like Amazon and eBay. E-commerce is changing the way business functions and creates a platform that lets people have the freedom to adopt new method and technology at a rapid faster rate. This growth was so fast it left people at Wall Street speechless with how far this business model can go far where, some analyst thought this technology would never make it. The documentary started off talking about the birth of Amazon and Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. All about numbers guy, who started off in analytics in walls street started his business in the back of a garage and shipping book by himself and a handful of people. Now the biggest e-commerce business in the 21st history. Then we move on to eBay who the founder wrote a few lines code and came up with the idea of making a website that can buy, sell, and bid on merchandise. Making it easy for their users to purchase merchandise that they have no access to, or hard to reach from miles away to the press of a button and then it comes to them in the mail. While it took people decades to adopt to the radio and even adopt television, both having to take an average of 20-40 years for people to adapt. However, when the internet was made public to people it took them 4 years and then they had over 50 million people using the world wide web. </p>

            <hr>
            <p class="container-fluid text-justify">How did the Dot com bubble become the giant it is well we can thank both Gordon Moore’s Law, Moore’s Law is how the speed and power of an integrated circuit in a microprocessor doubles every 18 month? Why it doubles 18 months because if you were to look overtime to see the number of steps it takes to double there really isn’t many steps needed. This gave engineers to make the transistors within a microprocessor smaller and smaller chip make it a more efficient chip with double the processing power. Another law we have to thank is Robert Metcalf he is the inventor of the ethernet, his theory was that every new node added to a network does not increase the computer the value of the network by one. However, it curves within the value of the network making it increasingly higher. These two laws goes hand and hand making the computer and the internet increase in performance and having people connected at a rapid pace. </p>
