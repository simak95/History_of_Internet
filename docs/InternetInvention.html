            <p class="lead text-center">The Internet is considered to be one of the greatest inventions of
                the twenty-first century. The greatness of it is on the same plane as the printing press
                or even the wheel because of how impactful it is in shaping our civilization.</p>

            <hr>
            <p class="container-fluid text-justify" >Dating back to the 1950s, a psychologist and computer
                scientist named J.C.R. Licklider envisioned that computers would allow us to communicate better
                and allow all computers to connect together to help share information better. His vision wasn't realized
                until 1960s when Leonard Kleinrock began applying his queuing theory to computers that led to the base
                of data transmission. Queuing theory is similar in concept to that of the USPS mailing process where the
                mail queue in line until they are released into their designated locations. He implemented two
                techniques, demand access and distributed control, in order to speed up the network to aid the data transmission process.

                attack would level American cities that the telephone system would be so damaged that the military
                would be unable to launch a counter-attack. To assure retaliation, America needed an indestructible
                communications network. Paul Baran was hired to see if one could be built. He and his team began by
                playing with fishnet type networks so that if you chop it up there's still a path through the network.</p>

                was only delivered by the post office online meant waiting behind someone at the movie theater and
                a server was a waitress at your favorite drive-in. Frustrations of a single ARPA - Advanced
                Research Projects  - scientist Bob Taylor, due to no two computers could talk to each other,
                Taylor had to move from terminal to terminal to work on a different computer. He knew a single
                terminal could suffice if all the computers were in a common Network. Taylor wanted to build a network
                because he thought it was crazy that he had to have three different terminals to talk to three
                different machines instead of one per mole. Taylor asked his boss for money to build a computer
                network arguing that it could save ARPA time money and resources, and he was allocated 1 million
                dollars to turn the theories of a computer network into a reality. This was enough to start a chain
                reaction that changed the world of course at the time nobody knew it we all knew that we were dealing
                with very powerful technology.</p>

                sponsored by ARPA sparked many interests including big telephone companies who were more interested in
                its failure than success. After the conference, the development of computer networks took off and
                network soon began to multiply throughout the Western world. The National Science Foundation made
                being on their network a requisite for receiving grant money. Soon others emerged.</p>

                the exclusive hands of government and into the public. The following November President Bush signed it
                into law. The Internet as turned loose into the the open world for commercial use for whatever use. A huge surge of commercial energy and competition and progress by allowing free enterprise and individualâ€™s access to the Internet. The seeds were planted that would flourish into many new and previously unimaginable.
                A physicist named Tim berners-lee at the CERN Research Institute in Switzerland created an easier way to access all the information in one hub. He developed the software to more easily follow threads of knowledge within the information stored throughout the internet. He named his invention the World Wide Web. It started growing on itself that went from just Tim in his little computer to a worldwide phenomenon carrying a billions going on trillions of dollars of Commerce. The World Wide Web made it easier to follow threads of information.</p>
